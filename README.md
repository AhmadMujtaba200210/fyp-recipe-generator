# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

what if packages deprecateed?

If you want to automatically update all deprecated packages to their latest versions without manually replacing each package name, you can use the `npm-check-updates` (ncu) tool. This tool allows you to upgrade your package.json dependencies to their latest versions.

First, install `npm-check-updates` globally:

```bash
npm install -g npm-check-updates
```

Then, you can use the following commands to update all deprecated packages:

```bash
# Check for outdated packages
ncu

# Upgrade package.json with the latest versions (including deprecated packages)
ncu -u

# Install the updated packages
npm install
```

The `ncu` command without the `-u` flag will only show you a list of outdated packages. The `-u` flag updates your `package.json` file with the latest versions. After updating the `package.json`, you can run `npm install` to install the new package versions.

Keep in mind that upgrading all packages automatically may introduce breaking changes, so it's crucial to test your application thoroughly after running these commands. Additionally, make sure to commit your changes to version control before updating dependencies.
